Version 0.6: Important change to URL convention.
             Switched from 'uri-1' to 'uri-2' convention,
             which uses the urlnorm library to normalize URIs.
	     This means
		1. There is now a dependency on urlnorm,
		   available from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/urlnorm.
		2. URIs are now, by default, standardized to INCLUDE
		   a trailing slash (when they represent directories etc.)
